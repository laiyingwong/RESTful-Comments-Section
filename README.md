# RESTful Comments Section

The simulated comment section is built with **RESTful** routes and it implements **CRUD** functionality. Users can add new comments, modify existing ones, and delete unwanted comments.

## ✨ What I Have Learned

**REST** (Representational States Transfer) uses the HTTP protocol’s request types (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`/`PATCH`, and `DELETE`) to allow users to **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**estroy/**D**elete (**CRUD**) via an API. The main idea of **REST** is treating data on the server-side as recources that can be CRUDed and making them easy to consume.

5 HTTP Methods:

`GET`: performs the read operation on data.

`POST`: creates a new resource in our database.

`PUT`: the client sends the entire updated object.

`PATCH`: the client sends only the modified part of the object.

`DELETE`: deletes resources (the client usually must be authenticated to perform DELETE).
